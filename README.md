# Calculating-Shapes-Using-Inheritance
This project is a Java console application developed as part of an assignment to model and manage 2D and 3D geometric shapes using object-oriented programming principles such as abstraction, inheritance, and polymorphism.

The application allows storing different geometric shapes and calculating their areas and volumes (where applicable) based on their attributes.
